# Lunar Calculator

A lunar calculator using [the USNO API](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/api.php)

Built to refresh my memory of Redux, get a bit more familiar with JSS, ESLint and
 Jest.

You can calculate the lunar phase you were born on, the current phase and it will
display the next lunar phase.

I might add a few extra bits on or style it a bit nicer, but for now it has served
its purpose.
